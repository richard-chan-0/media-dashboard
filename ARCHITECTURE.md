# Architecture and Design Decisions

## Overview

The Media Utility Dashboard is designed with a modular and scalable architecture to ensure maintainability and ease of feature expansion. Below are the key architectural decisions and their rationale:

### 1. **React Context for State Management**

- **Why**: Simplifies state sharing across deeply nested components without prop drilling.
- **How**:
    - `RenameContext` and `ManageContext` are used to manage state for renaming and volume management features, respectively.
    - Reducers (`renameReducer`, `pageReducer`) handle state transitions in a predictable manner.

### 2. **Component-Based Design**

- **Why**: Encourages reusability and separation of concerns.
- **How**:
    - Reusable components like `FormContainer`, `StageButton`, and `Modal` are located in `src/components`.
    - Feature-specific components are organized under `src/service`.

### 3. **API Layer Abstraction**

- **Why**: Centralizes API logic for better maintainability and testing.
- **How**:
    - API calls are encapsulated in `src/lib/api` (e.g., `api.ts`, `rename.ts`).
    - Utility functions like `postJson` and `postForm` handle common API patterns.

### 4. **Storybook for UI Development**

- **Why**: Provides a visual testing environment for components, enabling faster iteration and better documentation.
- **How**:
    - Stories are written for key components and stages (e.g., `NameChangePreview`, `SetStreams`).
    - Storybook configuration is located in `.storybook/`.

### 5. **Vitest for Testing**

- **Why**: Ensures robust unit testing with a focus on React components and hooks.
- **How**:
    - Test utilities like `renderWithProvider` simplify context-based testing.
    - Mocking is used extensively for API calls and context values.

### 6. **Tailwind CSS for Styling**

- **Why**: Provides a utility-first approach to styling, reducing the need for custom CSS.
- **How**:
    - Tailwind classes are used throughout components for consistent and responsive design.
    - Configuration is managed in `tailwind.config.js`.

## Future Considerations

### 1. **Scalability**

- Consider migrating to a state management library like Redux if the application grows significantly.
- Introduce lazy loading for routes and components to optimize performance.

### 2. **Testing Enhancements**

- Expand test coverage to include integration and end-to-end tests.
- Use tools like Playwright or Cypress for browser-based testing.

### 3. **Deployment Improvements**

- Automate Docker builds and deployments using CI/CD pipelines.
- Add health checks and monitoring for the deployed application.

### 4. **API Enhancements**

- Implement caching for frequently accessed API endpoints.
- Add retry logic for API calls to handle transient failures.
